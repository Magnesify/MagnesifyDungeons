# Magnesify Dungeons Documentation

You can enable dungeon creation with: **/Dungeons create**, If you want to cancel it, use **/Dungeons cancel**<br/>
Boss "Magnesify" is a default magnesify dungeons boss, I prefer you to a do not delete this boss, Becuse if you are using other plugin Bosses, there may have crash.

You can edit/create boss witth **/Boss** and you can edit your boss with **/Boss manage**<br/>
The documentation is not complicated and based on easy-way-understanding.

Dont forget, there is a 3 dungeon mode. Challange, Discovery Dungeons (Players can go anywhere on the map), And Level Based. <br/>
Create discovery dungeon: **/Discoverydungeons setup <Dungeon Name> <Dungeon Category>**

You can use help messages.<br/>
Good Luck.
