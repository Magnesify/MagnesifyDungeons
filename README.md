# Magnesify Dungeons Documentation

You can enable dungeon creation with: **/Dungeons create**, If you want to cancel it, use **/Dungeons cancel**
Boss "Magnesify" is a default magnesify dungeons boss, I prefer you to a do not delete this boss, Becuse if you are using other plugin Bosses, there may have crash.

You can edit/create boss witth **/Boss** and you can edit your boss with **/Boss manage**
The documentation is not complicated and based on easy-way-understanding.

You can use help messages.
Good Luck.
